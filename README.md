# Petrarchy

## Design is political

Petrarchy reaches back to the times of the Renaissance to find inspiration in
the origins of the rise out of the Dark Ages. Petrarch began with poetry,
creating the language to ignite the imagination about what the world could be.

We have descended into a new dark age, but it is time we discovered hope in the
vitality and creative energy of youth to dream a new world into existence.
